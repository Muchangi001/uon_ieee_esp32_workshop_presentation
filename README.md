## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 2.0 or higher)
- Dart (version 2.12 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone uon_ieee_esp32_workshop_presentation
cd uon_ieee_esp32_workshop_presentation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
flutter run
```

### For Web Deployment

```bash
flutter build web
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Customization

### Colors
The presentation uses a custom Rust-themed color palette:
- Primary: `#BC8C61` (Rust brown)
- Accent: `#E38C2D` (Rust orange)
- Background: `#1E1F23` (Dark gray)
- Card Background: `#2D2E32` (Lighter gray)

### Fonts
- Primary: FiraCode (for code blocks)
- Fallback: Roboto (for general text)

### Adding New Slides
1. Create a new slide method following the naming convention `_buildSlideName()`
2. Add the slide to the PageView children list in the build method
3. Update the `totalSlides` variable

## Technical Details

### Responsive Design
The presentation uses `LayoutBuilder` to adapt content based on screen width:
- Desktop: Side-by-side layouts with expanded content
- Mobile: Stacked layouts with appropriate spacing

### Animation System
- Fade transitions between slides
- Interactive animations for the bitwise demo
- Smooth page transitions

### Interactive Elements
- Bitwise operation demo with toggleable bits
- Navigation controls with slide indicators
- Responsive touch targets for mobile devices

## ESP32-C6 Information

The presentation includes detailed information about:
- ESP32-C6 peripherals and capabilities
- GPIO pin configurations and safe usage
- Rust ESP-HAL driver implementation
- Comparison with ESP32 WROOM32
